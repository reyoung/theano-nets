        The only input this constructor needs is the Python class of the network
        to build. Other configuration---for example, creating the appropriate
        trainer class---typically takes place by parsing command-line argument
        values.

        Datasets also need to be added to the experiment, either :

        - manually, by calling add_dataset(...), or
        - at runtime, by providing data to the run(train_data, valid_data)
          method.

        Datasets are typically provided as numpy arrays, but they can also be
        provided as callables, as described in the dataset module.

        Any keyword arguments provided to the constructor will be used to
        override values passed on the command line. (Typically this is used to
        provide experiment-specific default values for command line arguments
        that have no global defaults, e.g., network architecture.)
